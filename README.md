# Modelling DoctorVisits Dataset Using R

This is a project to predict patientsâ€™ medical treatment rate.

## Project Description
Predicting the number of visits patients make to a doctor based on their general demographics is of tremendous significance in identifying any factors that may hinder seeking medical attention. It is imperative to: 1) identify important variables that can effectively predict the number of visits, and 2) build a correctly specified prediction model. In this proposal, we discuss how we aim to accomplish these steps and build a well-specified prediction model for the number of doctor visits.
