# Modelling-the-DoctorVisits-dataset
This is a project to predict patientsâ€™ medical treatment rate
## Project Description
Predicting the number of visits made to a doctor based on general patient demographics has tremendous significance for identifying any factors that may hinder seeking medical attention. Thus, it is imperative to 1) identify important variables that can effectively predict the number of visits and 2) build a correctly specified prediction model. In this proposal, we discuss how we aim to accomplish these steps and build a well-specified prediction model for the number of doctor visits.
