# Modelling DoctorVisits Dataset Using R

This is a project to predict patientsâ€™ medical treatment rate.

## Project Description
Predicting the number of visits patients make to a doctor based on their general demographics is of tremendous significance in identifying any factors that may hinder seeking medical attention. It is imperative to: 1) identify important variables that can effectively predict the number of visits, and 2) build a correctly specified prediction model. In this proposal, we discuss how we aim to accomplish these steps and build a well-specified prediction model for the number of doctor visits.

## Files
1. The proposal file shows the project proposal, EDA of the dataset, and the approaches we will use in future analyses.

2. train.csv and test.csv contain the data we used to perform feature selections and build models.

3. The final project is our final report.
